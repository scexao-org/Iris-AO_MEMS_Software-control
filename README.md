# IRIS-AO_MEMS_Software-control

This github contains all the versions of the mems software code.

The actual folder which is used and that works properly in Meudon on FIRSTv2 bench is in this path:
/IrisAOCCMay20/example/linux64_python3/IrisAO_PythonAPI/
To install it on your oxn computer, just follow what's written in description.txt

It's this folder that is being used as a library to control the mems in FIRSTv2. By the way, the code proper to FIRSTv2 is in the folder /example_FIRSTv2/, but some parts of it wouldn't work on another machine, because of the use of path specific to my machine, for instance.

Enjoy your new life 3.6+
