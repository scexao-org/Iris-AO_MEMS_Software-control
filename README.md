# IRIS-AO_MEMS_Software-control

This github contains all the versions of the mems software code.

To install the Python 3+ IrisAO_PythonAPI, follow the guidelines in the file at this path:
/IrisAOCCMay20/example/linux64_python3/readme.txt

An example code corresponding to what is used on FIRSTv2 is in the folder /example_FIRSTv2/, but some parts of have to be adapted to your workspace. Finally, there are some parts that use ZeroMQ python library, but they have nothing to do with the mems, it's just a firstv2 software feature.

Enjoy your new life 3+
