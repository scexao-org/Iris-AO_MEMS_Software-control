# IRIS-AO_MEMS_Software-control

This github contains all the versions of the mems software code.

The folder to install in order to make the mems work on with python 3+ is in this path:
/IrisAOCCMay20/example/linux64_python3/IrisAO_PythonAPI/

To install it on your own computer, just follow what's written in description.txt

It's this folder that is being used as a library to control the mems in FIRSTv2 (you could be interested in the GUI). By the way, the code proper to FIRSTv2 is in the folder /example_FIRSTv2/, but some parts of it wouldn't work on another machine, because of the use of path specific to my machine, for instance. Finally, there are some parts that use ZeroMQ python library, but they have nothing to do with the mems, it's just a firstv2 software feature.

Enjoy your new life 3+
