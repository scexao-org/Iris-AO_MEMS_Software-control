Folder containing all the files necessary to build the IrisAO python API using IrisAO.Devices.dll

Files :
	- IrisAO.Devices.h:               Header file describing the library interface
	- IrisAO.Devices.lib:             Static library that links to the dynamic library
	- IrisAO.Devices.dll:             Dynamic library, loaded at runtime
	- setup.py:                       File used by distutils and cython to produce c++ code and compile it
	- IrisAO_Python.pyx:              Cython file, defines functions wrapping functions from the library4
	- IrisAO_Python_MirrorControl.py: File providing the python interface of the module, using the funtions
								      from the .pyd file
	- __init__.py 				      Required for the module to work properly. Imports all the functions 
									  from IrisAO_Python_MirrorControl.py
	- raisePythonException.cpp        c++ file that handles exceptions thrown by the dll and raises a Python
	 								  RuntimeError
	- raisePythonException.h          c++  header file that defines the function used to raise Python exceptions

The following files appear only after the execution of setup.py:
	- IrisAO_Python.cpp:              Appears after the execution of setup.py. C++ code produced by cython,
								      corresponding to the .pyx file
	- IrisAO_Python.pyd:              Appears after the execution of setup.py. Compiled version of the 
							          IrisAO_Python.cpp. The functions can be used directly from 
							          Python.


To compile the module:
	- Be sure to have the right compiler (Windows SDK from Windows 7, version 3.5 SP1)
	  It can be downloaded from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3138
	- Open a CMD Shell (installed from the package above)(The regular command prompt does not work here)
	- in CMD Shell, type (for 64 bits):
  		- set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1
  		- setenv /x64 /release
	- go to folder IrisAO_PythonAPI
	- type: python setup.py build_ext --inplace
If successful, the compilation should have produced the file IrisAO_Python.pyd


The folder can then be exported as a python module, the only 4 required for export files are:
	- IrisAO_Python.pyd
	- IrisAO_Python_MirrorControl.py
	- __init__.py
	- IrisAO.Devices.dll
